# AT-D878UVII Australia Codeplug

This is fork of original work https://github.com/VK1FAAA/AT-D878UV-Australia
Since 878UVII database has changed and some imports would not work.
I Fixed ONLY Channels list, Zones changed a lot in version II of this radio, would be labourious to fix, especially everyone creates Zones their own way.

## Use
Import Talkgroups.csv then Channels.csv
